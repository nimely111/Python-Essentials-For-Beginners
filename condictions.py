# In addition to variables, python also support quite a number of advance features as other procedural programming languages, such as cndictions.
# So, let's ssee an example where a number is positive, negative or zero using python condictions

# convert string to an integer
n = int(input("Number: "))

if n > 0:
    print("n is positive")
elif n < 0:
    print("n is negavite")
else:
    print("n is zero")
