# using variable with a build-in function to see our output
name = input("Name: ")

# to see our output, we call the print function build-in function
print("Hello, " + name)
# the plus operator does couple of things in python. If there were two numbers, t will add them, or if there are two strings as we have it will concatenate or combile them with the variable available.

# This is one way you can manipulate strings in python. another way to manipulate strings in ater versions of python is by using f strings (formated strings)
print(f"Hello, {name}")
